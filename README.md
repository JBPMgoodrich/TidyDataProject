# TidyDataProject

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data used for this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

This project repo contains one R script called [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/coursera-2015/TidyDataProject/blob/master/run_analysis.R) that does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This project repo also contains a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the work that was performed to clean up the data called [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/coursera-2015/TidyDataProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
